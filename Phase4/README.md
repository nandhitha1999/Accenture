# PHASE 4 - Client Communication

### 5. Fix the errors
Towards the final weeks, the team is monitoring the effects of the website UX changes, and refining the design of the management information (MI) dashboard.

Some errors has spotted and we need to investigate urgently,but you also need to let Henry know in the meantime. Now, we have to work quickly to review the draft email and spot errors, if any.

### 6. Choose the language
Henry has responded well to the team's work, and has been open and collaborative in a professional context, if a little guarded about personal matters. This issue could jeopardise that relationship; it wasn't easy for him to secure the necessary approvals and funding to get support from a professional services firm to tackle the problems, so if there's a danger we've now created a new problem on top... well, that's not going to make anyone look good.

Now, think how to respond to Henry's note - and remember that people can be much more emotional and reactive when they're under pressure.
