# PHASE 5 - Prioritisation & Impact Assessment

This phase focuses on reviewing and prioritising a clientâ€™s ideas, to recommend a mix of short-term and longer-term initiatives that fit within their budget.Score each initiative by impact and ease.

## 7. Prioritisation & Impact Assessment
The initial six-week project is now drawing to a close. The issues identified during module four have been resolved - thankfully, the error was limited to how the expenses were recorded, rather than the actual reimbursements - and the client is happy that the top-priority UX changes have had a positive effect on the user experience... and that the negative publicity seems to have died down.

Now that the most critical changes have been made, the client is starting to think about longer-term initiatives - and whether you might be able to help them to decide what to focus on next. They have lots of ideas, but they're finding it hard to prioritise... and with a limited budget, being able to prioritise is critical!

**TASK**
Your team has agreed that, exactly as Henry suggested, you need to use a framework to assess and compare the candidate initiatives - and that the best approach is to assign each idea a score for 'ease' (5 = easiest and 1 = hardest), i.e. how straightforward it should be to undertake), and for 'impact' (5 = most impact and 1 = least impact), i.e. to what extent it has a positive effect on operating costs, effectiveness, or student/staff experience.

With these scores assigned, it'll be relatively easy to plot the initiatives onto a matrix - and then select an affordable mix of ideas from the top-scoring initiatives. Don't forget, too, that Henry wants a mix of longer-term strategic projects, and things which will deliver value in the near-term; this might be a little subjective, but you'll need to infer which iniatives fit into which category based on the descriptions.
