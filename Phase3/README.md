**3. Outcome Analysis**
Quentions queried by the client:

- **Q1:** Since the most recent changes went live on June 7th, how many students have logged into the site?

- **Q2:** I had an email from the Student Support Team at UAN (University of Alpha November) – apparently their students are having problems with the site after the most recent changes went live on June 7th?  Can you see if there’s a particular problem there please?

- **Q3:** You mentioned we’ve seen a marked increase in successful claim submissions since the changes went live – what’s the increase you were describing?
