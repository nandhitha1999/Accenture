# PHASE 1 - Project Priorities & Planning

## 1. Select Project Priorities

**Task Instructions:**

Before meeting Henry, you'll need to show that you understood his key priorities for the project, and that you have a plan to tackle them.

To start, review the input materials again and identify which three priorities you think are best to tell the client will be your team's main focus.


## 2. Assemble a plan

**Task Instructions:**
Identify the key activities you think should feature on a simple 'plan on a page' slide to show to Henry on Monday. The activities should be grouped into:
- 'current state view' work (to understand the current user journey and how it's performing)

- 'design' work (to gather design inputs - e.g. examples from elsewhere - and prioritise UX changes for detailed design)

- 'rollout' work (to make the changes and ensure they're working as intended)

**Guidance:**
- Don't  make the plan to be too confusing

- Main thing you need to achieve: quick win changes to the website UX

- You only have six weeks - you need to be efficient, but without taking shortcuts

- The plan can add up to more than six weeks, since the team can tackle some things in parallel - but think about which ones and when
