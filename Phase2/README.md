### 3. Develop insights

**Q1**: This is the current user login screen. Based on the data available, what changes would you recommend?

**Q2**: This is the main menu, shown immediately after login. Any urgent changes we should make, based on your analysis?

**Q3**: This is the first screen shown when an existing user begins to apply for a new rebate for an academic expense they have incurred. What changes would you recommend?

**Q4**: This screen allows a user to enter the details of a specific expense item. What changes would you recommend?

**Q5**: On this screen, users upload a copy of the receipt or invoice for the expense they are claiming. Do you want to change where it fits within the screen flow?

**Q6**: This screen is where the student provides their bank details, to receive their expense reimbursement. Do we need to make any ‘quick win’ changes to this page?

**Q7**: This is the final screen shown to a student once they have submitted a new expense claim. How can it be improved?
