# Accenture

This repository contains all the relevant files that I tackled  as part of the Accenture Discovery Program.

The Accenture Discovery Program simulates a real client project where I was able to explore and gain experience of how to Plan and Execute a project with respect to all aspects.

1. Project Priorities & Planning

2. User Journey Redesign

3. Outcomes Analysis

4. Client Communication

5. Prioritisation & Impact Assessment
